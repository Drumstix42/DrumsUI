# History of the UI
The interface originally began as individual window modifications, available to download individual to mix and match as seen fit. Eventually the project became a full-interface mod release available in one package. Between the full interface, and invidiual window mods, the list grew to over 30 contributions to the custom interfaces available at [EQ2Interface](http://eq2interface.com). The full list of my mods are available [here](http://www.eq2interface.com/list.php?skinnerid=1506).

By work of Kaldran, DrumsUI was eventually able to have a Java-based Updater (like ProfitUI originally used) that users could run to grab the latest updates via HTTP instead of manual installation & updates via http://eq2interface.com

The main focus and goal was always to improve upon the Default UI: Slim down the look & feel, add extra useful information to display, and most importantly allow as much customization (and persistent options) for the user as possible.

While a lot of the individual UI mods were maintained along side the full-interface while I was still actively playing, they are no longer updated separately.

Since my departure from the game and active development on the UI (circa 2015), the community has greatly contributed to the project!
EQ2i user **Blackhood** took over the main development and maintenance. This has included patch update compatibilty, as well as implementation of fixes and improvements to the UI. EQ2i user **Mysstie** has also contributed changes and frequent feedback to the cause. Many other individuals have also contributed files, EQ2i patches, or feedback to help keep DrumsUI alive over the years.
